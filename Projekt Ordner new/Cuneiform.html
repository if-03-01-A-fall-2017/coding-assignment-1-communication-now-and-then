      <h1>History of Writing</h1>
        <p>In the history of how systems of representation of language
           through graphic means have evolved in different human civilizations,
            more complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of ideographic or early mnemonic symbols.
             True writing, in which the content of a linguistic utterance is encoded so that another
              reader can reconstruct, with a fair degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down,
               is a later development. It is distinguished from proto-writing, which typically avoids encoding
                grammatical words and affixes, making it more difficult or impossible to reconstruct the exact meaning
                 intended by the writer unless a great deal of context is already known in advance. One of the earliest forms
                  of written expression is cuneiform.</p>

                     <h2>Cuneiform Script</h2>
                     <p>The cuneiform writing system was in use for more than three millennia,
                        through several stages of development, from the 34th century BC down to the second century AD.
                          Ultimately, it was completely replaced by alphabetic writing (in the general sense)
                           in the course of the Roman era, and there are no cuneiform systems in current use.
                            It had to be deciphered as a completely unknown writing system in 19th-century Assyriology.
                             Successful completion of its deciphering is dated to 1857.</p>
                             <p>The cuneiform script underwent considerable changes over a period of more than two millennia.<br>
                                The image below shows the development of the sign SAG "head" (Borger nr. 184, U+12295 ð’Š•).
