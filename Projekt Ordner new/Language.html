    <h1>Language</h1>
    <p>Language is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of communication.</p>
    <p>Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages
      to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur.
      A group of languages that descends from a common ancestor is known as a language family. </p>
