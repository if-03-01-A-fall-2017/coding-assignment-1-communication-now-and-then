      <h1>Smoke signals</h1>
        <p>The smoke signal is one of the oldest forms of long-distance communication.
          It is a form of visual communication used over long distance.
          In general smoke signals are used to transmit news, signal danger,
           or gather people to a common area.</p>

              <h2>History and usage</h2>
              <p>In ancient China, soldiers stationed along the Great Wall
                 would alert each other of impending enemy attack by signaling from tower to tower.
                  In this way, they were able to transmit a message as far away as 750 kilometres in just a few hours.</p>

              <p>The North American indigenous peoples also communicated via smoke signal.
                 Each tribe had its own signaling system and understanding.
                  A signaler started a fire on an elevation typically using damp grass,
                   which would cause a column of smoke to rise. The grass would be taken off as
                    it dried and another bundle would be placed on the fire. Reputedly the location
                     of the smoke along the incline conveyed a meaning. If it came from halfway up the hill,
                      this would signify all was well, but from the top of the hill it would signify danger.
                      <br>
                      Smoke signals are no longer really used today, except in the military.
